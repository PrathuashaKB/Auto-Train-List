ðŸš†*Instantly Generate Your Train Passenger Manifest!*

AutoTrainList is a lightweight, responsive web application built to simplify the process of capturing and managing passenger data for train travel. Users can easily enter details such as passenger name, contact number, train number, source and destination stations, and the journey date â€” and the system instantly generates a structured passenger list.
This project was developed as part of **Assignment_2** for the Web Development subject, and showcases the ability to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap together for practical frontend development.
It serves as a hands-on implementation of frontend technologies, demonstrating how real-world transport-based forms and manifests can be digitalized for efficiency.
